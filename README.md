# AI - Homework Assignment - TSP Problem
The project contains the following modules: DFS, LCS, AStar, TSP Parser, TSP Utils.
Directly running the project will run it with non - trivial input data. Using the "ulysses22.tsp" file, the program will output the list of cities, the distance matrix of the said cities, and the costs of all three search functions.
To change the file used, so to switch to "burma14.tsp", simply change the filename found in main.cpp at line 8.
